This is probably the most commonly-asked question. And not without reason: you want to know what you're getting into, right? The problem is that it's actually tougher to answer than you might think. It's not that we're withholding information or trying keep information from our clients. Much to the contrary, I wish I could come up with _the perfect estimation tool:_ it would help us with our scheduling and clear up lots of problems.

## Off-The-Shelf, "Blah" Web Applications

Here's one way to mitigate the problem: just buy a cookie-cutter web page online and be on your way. Actually, a lot of people are doing this with some amount of success: you find the pre-made web page the most matches your description, buy it, and then have someone trim off all the edges you don't want and paste in the stuff the you _do_ want, but was missing. Ta-da! Done and done.

Fine.

But that's not actually what you want right? A reconstituted, pre-digested website that just needs a tweak here and a tweak there, but looks just like the other 30,000 websites that use that template? If you do, then we're not the right solution for you. We can do it, of course (we have before), but not at the price you would want (we hire the best). Probably what you're looking for is a lot more specific, personalize, _disruptive_, and... well, cool.

## Enter Custom Development

The other way to go about things is in a more customized manner. Imagine that you want to build your dream house. You've got plans in your head from watching all those design reality TV shows, you've maybe even sketched up some things and taken pictures of houses you like. There's the amazing kitchen, the to-die-for patio, and the rocking man-cave. After a while, you think you've got it all down, so you hand your local designer a stack of drawings and photos and ask, "okay, so how much?" More than likely, he'll give you a puzzle look and respond, "Aaaaaah, I don't know yet."

The problem is that the builder doesn't know whether that picture included mahogany cabinets or oak. Did the man-cave have surround-sound, THX-certified speakers? Did you want those vases, or did they just happen to be in the pictures. So, instead, you find the best design firm that you can and you start a conversation with them. Maybe in your picture, you have something that's actually structurally impossible when combined: discussing things with experts first can help you avoid disaster and a lot of wasted money. Perhaps they even have some great ideas that you hadn't even considered.

That's how we build software.

## How About an Estimate?

Fair enough. One sticky problem with giving an estimate is that unlike a building project, software is far more indeterminate, especially at the beginning of the project.

Okay, so let's just plan it all out so that we know everything before we started. In essence, we're trying to eliminate _uncertainty_ before we start coding, so our process could be expressed like this:

{: class="text-center"}

The problem is that often, what you _think_ you want in the beginning, doesn't turn out to be what you want in the end. In addition, it's only when we get to the real meat of coding that we start learning about the application: how the users react to code (oh, you mean that we should show this to _users??_), what the market is demanding, and what features are actually important to users.

So, rather than thinking that we can spec-out uncertainty, we _embrace_ it and start off with just enough information to create a product that can be put into the hands of _real users_. It's a more intuitive thing to do, and if we were to graph it, it might look more like this:

![Agile Process](/images/Agile-Process.png)
{: class="text-center" }

Another insidious aspect to giving a fixed-bid quote is that it pits us against each other: client against development team. We try to finish as soon as possible to preserve our margin while you try to shove as much stuff into that fixed bid as you can. What's the result? Rushed, crappy software, a dissatisfied client, and frazzled developers. If you're going to spend good money on software, wouldn't you rather get what you want rather than what you _thought_ you wanted three months ago?

## Okay, So How About a Range?

Sure, that _is_ something that we can do. When I talk to a client about a project, I can get a basic indication of the size of a project. This is usually an expression of the number of months:

| Project Size | Time               | Cost        |
|--------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Small        | 1-3 Months         | $6k - $18k  |
| Medium       | 3-6 Months         | $18k - $36k |
| Large        | More than 6 months | $36k+       |

## It Starts With a Conversation

Rather than requiring a 300-page description of what you think you might want, we start with an email or Skype conversation about what you dream about. At that point, we can talk about whether your project seems like a Small, Medium, or Big One. If that doesn't fit with your budget, then you can decide whether you want to increase your budget or maybe reduce the number of must-have features.

Once we have your application sized properly, we'll set up a web conference with our development team. This will give you a chance to share your vision with them (we want to catch it!) and talk through the features you have in mind.

After that's all done, we'll arrange for the first month of development to be paid for, lock in your dedicated development team, and start pounding away at the highest-value features.
